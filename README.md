Final project for CPSC 452/552 Spring 2023.

### Team members:
Jakub Bester, Nikhil Harle, Frank Li, Ioannis Panitsas, Connor Totilas

## Project timeline:
Now-April 15th: get barebones version running.
- Make dataset (https://github.com/IBM/observation-majorana)
- Import QCNN code into Github (https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/qcnn)
- Running and troubleshooting

April 15th-April 22nd: go off in different directions (see above). 
- 2 people try different topological state
- 3 people try adjusting structure

April 22nd: Reconvene and start putting together paper!
- Introduction
- Problem Setting/Motivation
- QCNN approach
- What we do differently
- Results

## List of possible directions:
1. Try for different topological states (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17548)
2. Optimization for fault-tolerant operations on QEC code spaces
3. Experiment with other loss functions, adjustments to QCNN structure, etc.
- Implement parallel feature maps
- Implement backpropogation
- Implement skip connections
