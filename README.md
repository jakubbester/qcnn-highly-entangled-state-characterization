List of possible directions:
1. Try for different topological states (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17548)
2. Optimization for fault-tolerant operations on QEC code spaces
3. Experiment with other loss functions, adjustments to QCNN structure, etc.
- Implement parallel feature maps
- Implement backpropogation
- Implement skip connections


Project timeline:
Now-April 15th: get barebones version running.
April 15th-April 22nd: go off in different directions (see above). 2 people try different topological state, 3 people try adjusting structure.
April 22nd: Reconvene and start putting together paper
